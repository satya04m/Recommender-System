## Pipeline Flow

- **Data Collection**: Gathering and preprocessing data.
- **Model Training**: Using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model’s performance using metrics like RMSE or precision.
- **Containerization**: Containerizing the application using Docker.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: 
  - **Code Commit & Push**: Code is pushed to the GitHub repository.
  - **GitHub Actions Trigger**: GitHub Actions triggers the pipeline upon code push.
  - **Build & Test**: Builds the application and runs tests.
  - **Docker Build**: Builds a Docker image of the application.
  - **Push Docker Image**: Pushes the Docker image to a container registry.
  - **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
  - **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and logging the application’s performance.
